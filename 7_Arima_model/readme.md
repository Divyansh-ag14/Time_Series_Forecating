## ARIMA Model (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)

### ● Exponential smoothing models were based on a description of level, trend and seasonality in the data
### ● ARIMA models aim to describe the correlations in the data with each other

## Parameters of ARIMA model

### ● ARIMA has three parameters

#### ○ AR - Lags describing autocorrelation: (p)
#### ○ I - Number of differencing for stationarity (q)
#### ○ MA - Lags describing partial autocorrelation (d)

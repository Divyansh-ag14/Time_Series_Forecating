## AR Model

### ● AR - Auto Regressive Time Series Model
#### ○ Regression of current value with the previous values

### ● This model is prefered when we have only trend in the series


## MA Model

### ● MA - Moving Average Time Series Model
#### ○ Regression of current values and previous error terms

### ● Preferably used when there are random spikes/jumps in the data

## ARMA (p,q):
###● ARMA models are composed of two models, the AR model and the MA model
###● AR or MA are not applicable on non-stationary series
#### The ARMA model of order (p,q) is: We can combine these two models by simply adding them together as a model of order (p,q), where we have p AR terms and q MA terms:

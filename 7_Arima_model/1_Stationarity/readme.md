## What is Stationarity?

### ● A stationary series is one whose statistical properties like – mean, variance, covariance do not vary with time.

### ● Stationary Series will have 

#### ○ Constant mean 
#### ○ Constant variance
#### ○ Constant covariance

### ● A Series with trend and seasonality is not stationary


## Types of Stationarity in Time Serie

### ● Strict Stationary: 

#### ○ Satisfies the mathematical definition of a stationary process. 
#### ○ The mean, variance and covariance are not the function of time. 

### ● Trend Stationary:

#### ○ A series exhibits a trend is referred to as a trend stationary series. 
#### ○ Once the trend is removed, the resulting series will be strict stationary
